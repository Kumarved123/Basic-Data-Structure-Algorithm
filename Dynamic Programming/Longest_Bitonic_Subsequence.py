#Longest Bitonic Subsequence
'''Given an array arr[0 â€¦ n-1] containing n positive integers, a subsequence of
arr[] is called Bitonic if it is first increasing, then decreasing. Write a
function that takes an array as argument and returns the length of the longest
bitonic subsequence. A sequence, sorted in increasing order is considered Bitonic
with the decreasing part as empty. Similarly, decreasing order sequence is
considered Bitonic with the increasing part as empty.'''
